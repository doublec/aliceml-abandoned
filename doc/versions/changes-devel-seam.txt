Language:

* Nicer syntax (derived forms) for functors.

Compiler:

* Warn about unsued imports.

Interactive Toplevel:

* Enable Ctrl-C for interrupting a computation.
* Enable Ctrl-Z for putting a computation into background.

Runtime system:

* Completely new VM called Seam (Simple Efficient Abstract Machine).
  It uses just-in-time compilation and a 3 generation garbage collector,
  rendering it up to 5 times faster than Alice on Mozart.
* Completely new, extended constraint library based on Gecode
  (Generic Constraint Development Environment). It adds
  selection constraints, batch recomputation and distributed search.
  Propagation and search is more than 10 times faster than with Mozart.
* Mozart is no longer required to run Alice.

Library:

* New interface to the constraint library, due to Gecode.
* A new binding for Gtk 2, with a lot of interface changes.
* Default int type is now 31 bit, infinite precision integers are
  available through the IntInf structure.
* Added FixedInt.
* Semantics of holes fixed.

Tools:

* Reimplemented inspector can show type information and inspect modules.
* Reimplemented explorer can do auto-zooming and anti-aliasing and has
  support for visualizing distributed search.


Alice 0.9.3 (Stockhausen Operette 3 Remix 3) - 2004/04/15
---------------------------------------------------------

Language:

  generic library functions like printVal.

* Added disjoint function to set and map types.
* Atom: moved to lib/data.
* Real: added checkFloat.
* Real: fixed isFinite.
* Thread: fixed exception handling.
* *VectorSlice,Substring: fixed splitr (also fixes OS.Path.split*).
* CharArraySlice: fixed.
* PrimIO: fixed augment{Reader,Writer}.
* Gtk: fixed string list marshalling (e.g. for clist/ctree functions).
* FD: added SPLIT_MIN/SPLIT_MAX distributor.

Runtime system:

* Adapted to Mozart 1.3.

Documentation:

* Man pages.
* Clarified limitations of mapping in Linear module.
* Updates.


Alice 0.9.2 (Stockhausen Operette 3 Remix 2) - 2003/07/25
---------------------------------------------------------

Library:

* Added data structure library under x-alice:/lib/data with functional and
  imperative sets, maps, stacks, and stamps.
* Added Array2.
* Added OS.Path.
* Defined and fixed behaviour of proxies in the presence of
  sited values and failed futures.
* Fixed race condition in Future.awaitEither.
* Renamed UniqueString to Atom.
* Added WideText and WideChar{Vector,Array}[Slice].
* Added List.split.
* Added Substring.{position,fields,tokens}.
* Corrected treatment of exceptions in Lock.sync.
* FD and FS set constructors now perform domain checking.
* FD and FS now raise Tell exception on toplevel constraints.
* Fixed broken GTK signal handling (disconnect/block/unblock/emit).
* Fixed broken string type in GTK.
* Renamed some GTK types to meet SML conventions.

Compiler:

* New naming convention warning.
* Automatic .import file prepending for .sml sources.
* Automatic import generation from dependency files (option --dependency-file).
* Fixed translation of "fun spawn ..." derived form.


Alice 0.9.1 (Stockhausen Operette 3 Remix 1) - 2003/02/13
---------------------------------------------------------

Interactive toplevel:

* Don't barf on Oz exceptions (particularly generated by failed spaces).
* Minor cosmetics in output of values (futures, some abstract types).


Library:

* Proxy calls are now performed concurrently instead of sequentially.
* HTTPServer and HTTPClient implement persistent connections.
* Added Url.toLocalFile.
* Changed type of Config.homeDir.

* Bug fixes.


Inspector:

* Display values more consistently with interactive toplevel.
* References are now updated correctly.


Runtime system:

* Now runs with official Mozart 1.2.5 release.
* Renamed environment variable STOCKHOME to ALICE_HOME.
* Added support for ALICE_LOAD_PREFIX and ALICE_LOAD_SUFFIX variables.
* Support file names containing spaces.


Linker:

* Perform true Url resolution instead of string prefix matching.
