Language:

* Syntactic sugar for finalization.
* Nicer syntax (derived forms) for functors.
* Lazy and spawn syntax for modules.
* Pack can now use a transparent annotation, as this is usually more convenient.
* Fully dynamic component typing: link-time type checking now is fully
  parametric in abstract import types and takes into account the *dynamic*
  types exported by respective components. This implies at least two things:
  - Less need for recompilation. Recompilation of a component exporting
    abstract types no longer forces recompilation of dependent components.
  - Smooth interaction with pickles. Abstract types in compiled components are
    no longer incompatible with abstract types in pickled components.

Compiler:

* Dynamic sealing has been implemented.
* Warn about unused imports (switch --(no-)warn-unused-imports).
* Warn about inaccessible type and signature names appearing in inferred
  component signature (switch --(no-)warn-inaccessible-exports).
* Inaccessible types occuring in inferred /import/ signatures are now an error.
* To accommodate with the new dynamic import typing, the compiler now closes
  over all implicit import signatures, by potentially inserting additional
  imports for abstract types and signatures imported transitively. Optional
  warnings for added imports (switch --warn-added-imports).
* Support for giving multiple source files on command line.
* Import URLs are now resolved relative to the out-file location when compiling,
  allowing proper separation of source and build directories.
* Support for smart recompilation, taking component signatures into account.

Linker:

* Rewritten to soundly support dynamic component typing.
* Disallow cyclic linking.
* Print free type names appearing in component signature with -d option.

Interactive Toplevel:

* Enable Ctrl-C for interrupting a computation.
* Enable Ctrl-Z for putting a computation into background (new Alice thread).
* Function exit() as an alternative for Ctrl-D in broken environments.
* Value printer is customizable for abstract types.
* Fixed off-by-one line numbers, including use function.

Library:

* Component:
  - Added fromPackage.
  - Create now takes a functor as argument to support unevaluated components.
  - Added exception Internal.
* ComponentManager:
  - Added load function.
  - Functions eval and link return packages now.
  - Link and link are no longer lazy.
  - Removed start (equivalent to ignore o link).
  - logStream reference to configure trace destinations. Preconfigurable
    through value of ALICE_TRACE_COMPONENT.
  - Trace messages are more informative, particularly wrt signature mismatches.
* Toplevel: Future.await is now available unqualified.
* Word32 added. LargeWord = Word32 now, but Word = Word31 remains.
* Exn: new structure for dealing with exceptions and backtraces.
* OS.Process: atExn takes an Exn.packet now.
* Promise:
  - Equality now works properly.
  - Added isFulfilled predicate.
  - Fulfilling with a cycle no longer fails the promise.
* Hole: future now simply returns argument if not a hole (no exception).
* Alt: added mapBoth.
* Pair: added mapBoth.
* List[Pair]:
  - Added exists[i]Eq and filter[i]Eq.
  - Fixed evaluation order of filter[i] and partition[i].
* Vector, {Char,Word8}Vector: fixed update to raise Subscript for bad indices.
* VectorPair: fixed foldri.
* VectorSlice: fixed toVector.
* ArraySlice, {Char,Word8}ArraySlice: fixed copying overlapping slices.
* Char: fixed scan, scanC, fromCString.
* String: fixed isSubstring, scanC, fromCString.
* Substring: fixed isSubstring, tokens.
* StringCvt: fixed pad{Left,Right}.
* ByNeed: moved to Future structure.
* Future: added ByNeed and Concur functors.
* Lock: sync is now re-entrant.
* Package: deleted separate val_package type.
* TextIO, StreamIO: fixed buffering of TTY output.
* TextIO: implemented CR/NL translation properly.
* PrimIO: new functions openVectorList{Rd,Wr}, useful for internal redirection.
* GlobalStamp: fixed toString.
* Channel: new module for concurrent message channels.
* Print: added function register for hooking user-defined printing functions.
* Config: added buildDate, version, and codename.
* Http: ignore multiple headers; replace empty reguest URIs with "/".
* Remote:
  - Added functor Proxy to conveniently wrap a whole module into proxies.
  - Replaced Execute functor by two function/functors eval/Eval and run/Run.
    The former terminates after evaluation of the mobile component, the latter
    keeps the process alive.
  - More error conditions distinguished by eval/run. Uncaught exceptions on the
    remote site are now propagated back to the caller.
* Gtk library: simplified structure, all types are now defined in GtkTypes.
