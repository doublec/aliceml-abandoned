<P>Alice ML is an extension of the <A

<?php section("interactive", "interactive toplevel") ?>

<P>Alice ML is an extension of Standard ML, and the Alice
<A href="interactive.html">interactive toplevel</A>
works very similar to the interactive prompts known from other SML
systems, where you can type in expressions and declarations to evaluate them.
Input is terminated with a semicolon. For example, you might simply perform a
simple calculation:</P>

<PRE class=code>
- 4+5;
<I>val it : int = 9</I></PRE>

<P>The expression is evaluated and the result <TT>9</TT> printed along with
its inferred type <TT>int</TT>. Anonymous expressions get the name <TT>it</TT>,
so that you can refer to them in consecutive inputs:</P>

<PRE class=code>
- 2*it;
<I>val it : int = 18</I></PRE>

<P>We can also try the one-line Hello World program:</P>

<PRE class=code>
- print "Hello world!\n";
<I>Hello world!
val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<DIV class=note>
<P><I>Note:</I> In the rest of this tour we will present
program fragments in their pure form, without showing the interactive prompt or
the semicolon terminating the interactive input. For example, the last
interaction will be displayed simply as</P>

<PRE class=code>
print "Hello world!\n"
<I>Hello world!
val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>
</DIV>

<P>Entering a function declaration is more interesting. For example,
the factorial function:<P>

<PRE class=code>
fun fac 0 = 1
  | fac n = n * fac (n-1)
<I>val fac : int -> int = _fn</I></PRE>

<P>This time, the result has a more complex type: it is a function from
integers to integers. We can apply that function:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fac 12
<I>val it : int = 479001600</I></PRE>

<DIV class=note>
<P><I>Note:</I> If a computation takes too long you can abort it in the interactive toplevel by entering Ctrl-C (Ctrl-Break on Windows). You can also put it into background with Ctrl-Z (Ctrl-D on Windows). The result of a background computation will be represented by futures, see <A href="#concurrency">discussion of concurrency</A> below. The interactive toplevel is exited with Ctrl-D (Ctrl-Z on Windows), or by calling <TT>exit()</TT>.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the shell used, Ctrl sequences may not work as expected under Windows.
</P>
</DIV>

<?php subsection("interactive-inspector", "The Inspector") ?>

<P>For more complex values, plain static output of the result is often
insufficient. The Alice system includes the <A
href="library/inspector.html"><EM>Inspector</EM></A> for browsing arbitrary data
structures interactively:</P>

<PRE class=code>
inspect (List.tabulate (10, fn i => (i, i*i, i*i*i)))
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P>An Inspector window will pop up displaying the table of square and cubic
numbers:</P>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-1.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<P>When you inspect additional values, they will be displayed in the same
Inspector window. The inspector can be used to browse arbitrary data
structures:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val r = ref 56
<I>val r : int ref = ref 56</I>
inspect (3 + 8, SOME 3.141592, {hello = "hello, world"}, r, [true, 4 < 3])
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-2.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<P class=note><EM>Note:</EM> If the size of the inspected data structure
exceeds certain configurable limits, parts of the output will be hidden. Those
parts are represented by arrows, which can be interactively unfolded if
desired.</P>

<P>The Inspector concurrently watches the data structures it shows. If they
change, it will notice it and update its display. For example, if you re-assign
a reference the Inspector window will be updated automatically:</P>

<PRE class=code>
r := 33033
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-3.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<!--
<PRE class=code>
val rec infiniteList = 1::infiniteList
<I>val infiniteList : int list =
   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...]</I>
inspect infiniteList
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<PRE class=code>
inspect (Future.alarm (Time.fromMilliseconds (Int.toLarge 2000)))
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>
-->


<?php section("laziness", "laziness") ?>

<P>While Standard ML is a fully eager (strict) language, Alice ML provides
support for optional lazy evaluation. Any expression can be evaluated lazily by
preceeding it with the <TT>lazy</TT> keyword:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val x = lazy 4+5
<I>val x : int = _lazy</I></PRE>

<P>Lazy suspensions are represented by the <TT>_lazy</TT> notation in the
interactive toplevel's output, as shown above. The value of <TT>x</TT> will not
be computed before it is actually required. For example,</P>

<PRE class=code>
(x,x)
<I>val it : int * int = (_lazy, _lazy)</I>
x
<I>val it : int = _lazy</I>
x > 10
<I>val it : bool = false</I>
x
<I>val it : int = 9</I></PRE>

<P>Tupling is parametric in its components and does not trigger <TT>x</TT>. The
comparison operator <TT>></TT> is strict in its arguments, however, and hence
forces evaluation of <TT>x</TT>. Likewise, pattern matching, arithmetic
operations, comparison (<TT>op=</TT>) or similar operations can force a
value.</P>

<P>As a simple example of a lazy function, consider a generator for lazy
streams of numbers:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fun enum n = lazy n :: enum (n+1)
<I>val enum : int -> int list = _fn</I>
val ns = enum 0
<I>val ns : int list = _lazy</I>
List.nth (ns,5)
<I>val it : int = 5</I>
ns
<I>val it : int list = 0 :: 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: 4 :: 5 :: _lazy</I></PRE>

<P>In this example, requesting the 5th element of the list forced partial
evaluation of the list, up to that element.</P>

<P>We can define a lazy variant of the <TT>map</TT> function:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fun mapz f xs = lazy (case xs of nil    => nil
                               | x::xs' => f x :: mapz f xs')
<I>val mapz : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list = _fn</I></PRE>

<P>Note that the <TT>case</TT> expression must be nested inside the
<TT>lazy</TT> expression - otherwise applying <TT>mapz</TT> would trigger
evaluation of the head of the list, to perform the necessary pattern matching.
Function declarations support syntactic sugar that allows expressing the same
definition more elegantly:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fun lazy mapz f nil     = nil
  |      mapz f (x::xs) = f x :: mapz f xs
<I>val mapz : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list = _fn</I></PRE>

<P>This derived form is defined such that both definitions of <TT>mapz</TT> are
equivalent. Let us apply <TT>mapz</TT> to the stream of natural numbers
to calculate their factorials lazily:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val facs = mapz fac (enum 0)
<I>val facs : int list = _lazy</I>
List.take (facs,7)
<I>val it : int list = [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720]</I>
facs
<I>val it : int list = 1 :: 1 :: 2 :: 6 :: 24 :: 120 :: 720 :: _lazy</I></PRE>

<DIV class=note>
<P><EM>Note:</EM> The Inspector observes when lazy suspensions are triggered. If
you evaluate</P>

<PRE class=code>
inspect facs
<I>val it : unit = ()</I>
List.nth (facs,12)
<I>val it : int = 479001600</I></PRE>

<P>it will automatically update its window to reflect the substitution of the
lazy tail of <TT>facs</TT> by a (partial) list.</P>
</DIV>

<P>Here is a lazy version of the <TT>zip</TT> function:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fun lazy zipz (x::xs, y::ys) = (x,y) :: zipz (xs,ys)
  |      zipz       _        = nil
<I>val zipz : 'a list * 'b list -> ('a * 'b) list = _fn</I></PRE>

<P>It is possible to calculate the stream of Fibonacci numbers using
<TT>mapz</TT> and <TT>zipz</TT>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val rec fibs = 1 :: 1 :: (lazy mapz op+ (zipz (fibs, tl fibs)))
<I>val it : int list = 1 :: 1 :: _lazy</I>
List.nth (fibs, 10)
<I>val it : int = 89</I>
fibs
<I>val it : int list =
   1 :: 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: 5 :: 8 :: 13 :: 21 :: 34 :: 55 :: 89 :: _lazy</I></PRE>

<P>For more practical applications of laziness, see the standard literature
on lazy functional programming. Last but not least, note that Alice ML allows
laziness to be combined freely with side effects:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val n = lazy (print "Huhu!\n"; 13)
<I>val n : int = _lazy</I>
n+1
<I>Huhu!
val it : int = 14</I></PRE>


<?php section("concurrency", "concurrency") ?>

<P>Alice extends SML with support for concurrency. Concurrency is light-weight:
the system can handle tens or hundreds of thousands of concurrent threads.
Concurrent programming in Alice is uniformly based on the model of
<EM>futures</EM>.</P>

<P>A concurrent thread can be initiated by means of the <TT>spawn</TT>
expression:</P>

<PRE class=code>
spawn 45*68
<I>val it : int = _future</I></PRE>

<P>In this example the value 45*68 is computed in a new thread. The result of
the <TT>spawn</TT> expression is a <EM>future</EM>, a place-holder for the
result of the concurrent computation. Once the result becomes available, the
future will be globally replaced by the result. We say that threads are
<EM>functional</EM>, in the sense that they have a result.</P>

<DIV class=note>
<P><I>Note:</I> If you do not happen to have an ancient machine then you most likely will not have seen
the output above, but the result of the computation, because it performed faster
than the interactive toplevel was able to print it.</P>
</DIV>

<P>That semantics
becomes more obvious if we look at a thread that does not terminate
immediately. For that purpose, let us define the naive version of the Fibonacci
function, which has exponential complexity:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fun fib (0 | 1) = 1
  | fib n       = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
<I>val fib : int -> int = _fn</I></PRE>

<P>On an ordinary desktop PC, computing <TT>fib 35</TT> will take quite some
time. We perform that computation concurrently:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val n = spawn fib 35
<I>val n : int = _future</I></PRE>

<P>We get back a future, that we can look at using the Inspector:</P>

<PRE class=code>
inspect n
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-conc-1.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<P>At first, the Inspector will display the value as a future, as shown above.
Once the computation of the result finishes and the thread terminates, that
future gets replaced by the thread's result. The Inspector will update its
display accordingly:</P>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-conc-2.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<P>The situation becomes more interesting if we start several threads at
once:</P>

<PRE class=code>
inspect (List.tabulate (10, fn i => spawn fib (i+25)))
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P>The individual entries from the small table we build are calculated
concurrently and become available individually. At some point in time the
Inspector window might display the following:</P>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-conc-3.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>


<?php subsection("concurrency-sync", "Data-flow synchronization") ?>

<P>Futures can be passed around like ordinary values. Once an operation
actually <EM>requests</EM> the value the future stands for, the corresponding
thread will block until the future vanishes. This is known as <EM>data-flow
synchronisation</EM> and is a powerful mechanism for high-level concurrent
programming. As a trivial example, consider the following pair of concurrent
producer and consumer that are connected through a message stream:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val delay = Time.fromSeconds (Int.toLarge 2)
<I>val delay : Time.time = time{|2000000us|}</I>
fun produce 0 = []
  | produce n = spawn (Thread.sleep delay; n :: produce (n-1))
<I>val produce : int -> int list = _fn</I>
fun consume (n::ns) = (print (Int.toString n ^ "\n"); consume ns)
  | consume   nil   = ()
<I>val consume : int list -> 'a = _fn</I>
spawn consume (produce 5)
<I>val it : unit = _future
5
4
3
2
1</I></PRE>

<!-- TODO: Reference? -->

<P>Synchronisation on futures can also be done explicitly, by employing the
library function <A href="library/future.html"><TT>Future.await</TT></A>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Future.await (spawn fib 30)
<I>val it : int = 1346269</I></PRE>

<P>Interestingly, <A href="#laziness">lazy suspensions</A> are nothing but a
special form of future, called a <EM>lazy future</EM>. Requesting a lazy future
is triggering the corresponding computation. Consequently,
<TT>Future.await</TT> can also be used to trigger lazy computations
explicitly:</P>

<PRE class=code>
lazy 3+4
<I>val it : int = _lazy</I>
Future.await it
<I>val it : int = 7</I></PRE>


<?php subsection("concurrency-failure", "Failed futures") ?>

<P>What happens if a concurrent computation fails, e.g. by raising an exception?
In that case the future will be <EM>failed</EM>. A failed future carries an
exception indicating the cause of the failure. A failed future does not cause
failure of a client by itself. Only when a client actually requests the failed
future, the failure exception will be re-raised at the point of request:</P>

<PRE class=code>
spawn (raise Domain)
<I>val it : 'a = _future</I>
[it]
<I>val it : 'a list = [_failed{|Domain|}]</I>
hd it + 1
<I>uncaught exception Domain</I></PRE>

<P>In the second output, the interactive toplevel uses the notation
<TT>_failed{|exn|}</TT> to indicate a future with exception <TT>exn</TT>.</P>

<P>See the <A href="futures.html">manual page</A> on futures for a detailed
discussion of concurrency, futures, and failure.</P>


<?php subsection("concurrency-atomic", "Atomicity") ?>

<P>Dealing with state correctly in a concurrent environment requires the
availability of atomic operations. Alice provides an atomic exchange operation
for references:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val r = ref 10
<I>val r : int ref = ref 10</I>
Ref.exchange (r, 20)
<I>val it : int = 10</I></PRE>

<P>The value of the reference is extracted and replaced in one atomic
operation. See <A href="#promises-concurrent">below</A> for an example relying
on this function.</P>

<P class=note><EM>Note:</EM> Due to limitations of the Mozart virtual machine,
Alice does not yet provide an atomic exchange operation for arrays.</P>


<?php section("promises", "promises") ?>

<P>Functional threads and lazy evaluation offer convenient means to create
futures "on the fly". Often the direct coupling between a future and the
computation delivering its result is too inflexible, however. For such cases,
Alice offers <EM>promises</EM>.</P>

<P>A promise is an explicit handle for a future. When a promise is created,</P>

<PRE class=code>
open Promise
<I>val ...
val ...
...</I>
val p : int promise = promise ()
<I>val p : int Promise.promise = promise{|_future|}</I></PRE>

<P>an associated future is created along with it. This future can be obtained as
follows:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val x = future p
<I>val x : int = _future</I></PRE>

<P>Such a <EM>promised future</EM> behaves like a concurrent future, in
particular by allowing dataflow synchronisation. But unlike a concurrent or
lazy future it does not vanish automatically, but has to be eliminated
explicitly through the corresponding promise:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fulfill (p, 19)
<I>val it : unit = ()</I>
p
<I>val it : int Promise.promise = promise{|19|}</I>
x
<I>val it : int = 19</I></PRE>

<P>Intuitively, by creating a future this way, you create a place-holder for a
value that you "promise" to deliver at some later point in time. At that
point, you "fulfill" your promise. You can also break your promise, by failing
the future:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val p : int promise = promise ()
<I>val p : int Promise.promise = promise{|_future|}</I>
fail (p, Domain)
<I>val it : unit = ()</I>
p
<I>val it : int Promise.promise = promise{|_failed{|Domain|}|}</I></PRE>

<P>The future will be failed with the exception you pass to the <TT>fail</TT>
function. Any subsequent attempt to request the future will cause raise of that
exception, just as a failed concurrent future:<P>

<PRE class=code>
1 + future p
<I>uncaught exception Domain</I></PRE>

<P>A promise may only be fulfilled or failed once. Hence, a different view on
promises is that of a single assignment reference, yielding the following
correspondences:</P>

<PRE class=code>
type 'a promise                         type 'a ref
promise : unit -> 'a promise            ref : 'a -> 'a ref
future  : 'a promise -> 'a              !   : 'a ref -> 'a
fulfill : 'a promise * 'a -> unit       :=  : 'a ref * 'a -> unit</PRE>

<P>The important point is that a promise is not initialized (hence the
difference in the constructor types), and dereferencing it prior to assignment
delivers a place holder for its potential content.</P>


<?php subsection("promises-topdown", "Top-down construction of data structures") ?>

<P>Usage of promises is not necessarily related to concurrent programming. One
application is the top-down construction of data structures, as opposed to the
bottom-up construction usually required in functional programming. As a simple
example of that we show how promises can be utilised to program a
tail-recursive version of the list append function:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fun append (l1,l2) =
let
    fun iter (nil,   p) = fulfill (p, l2)
      | iter (x::xs, p) =
	let
	    val p' = promise ()
	in
            fulfill (p, x::future p'); iter (xs, p')
	end
    val p = promise ()
in
    iter (l1, p); future p
end
<I>val append : 'a list * 'a list -> 'a list = _fn</I></PRE>

<!--
<P class=note><EM>Note:</EM> When entering this example interactively you have
to put some white space after the semicolon in the <TT>let</TT> body.
Otherwise, unlike other SML interpreters, the interactive top-level of Alice
will assume it to terminate your input.</P>
-->

<P>The basic idea of this formulation of append is to cons the head of the left
operand to a future in each iteration. That future gets replaced by the actual
tail in the next iteration, with the tail again containing a future as its
respective tail. When we reach the end of the list, the last future gets
replaced by the right operand.</P>

<P>In a similar vein, arbitrary data structures can be generated in a top-down
manner by creating promised futures as place holders for parts of it and
construct them afterwards. This is reminiscent of techniques from logic
programming.</P>


<?php subsection("promises-concurrent", "Concurrent data structures") ?>

<P>Still, the primary purpose of promises is to provide a simple primitive that
enables high-level concurrent programming. We only give an idea of that here,
by showing how they can encode another well-known concurrency idiom easily:
<EM>channels</EM>.</P>

<P>A channel (sometimes also called a <EM>port</EM>) is a simple imperative
message queue that allows asynchronous communication between processes. As an
abstract data type it can be described by the following signature:</P>

<PRE class=code>
signature CHAN =
sig
    type 'a chan

    val chan : unit -> 'a chan
    val put :  'a chan * 'a -> unit
    val get :  'a chan -> 'a
end
</PRE>

<P>An arbitrary number of messages may be sent to a channel using <TT>put</TT>.
The <TT>get</TT> operation takes the oldest message out of the channel. It
suspends if none is available. A more advanced design might distinguish between
read and write view of a channel, but we chose to ignore that here for the sake
of simplicity.</P>

<P>A straight-forward implementation uses promises and references:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Chan :> CHAN =
struct
    open Promise

    type 'a chan = 'a list promise ref * 'a list ref

    fun chan () =
	let
	    val p = promise ()
	in
	    (ref p, ref (future p))
	end

    fun put ((putr,getr), x) =
	let
	    val p' = promise ()
	    val p  = Ref.exchange (putr, p')
	in
	    fulfill (p, x::future p')
	end

    fun get (putr, getr) =
	let
            val p' = promise ()
	    val xs = Ref.exchange (getr, future p')
        in
            fulfill (p', tl xs); hd xs
        end
end
</PRE>

<P>The implementation is a variation of a difference list: the first reference
stores the tail of the queue ("write position"), while the second points to
the head ("read position"). Modification of either position is performed by an
atomic exchange operation on the respective reference. That ensures that all
operations are properly sequentialized.</P>

<P>The tail is represented as a promised future. As in the append example
from the previous section this allows constructing the message queue
incrementally in the <TT>put</TT> function.</P>

<P>By using a promised future in the implementation of <TT>get</TT> we can use
atomic exchange although the new value actually depends on the previous one.
Any concurrent <TT>get</TT> operation will block automatically (in <TT>tl</TT>)
until the future is eliminated by fulfilling the promise. Consequently, no
<TT>get</TT> operation can proceed before the former has determined the new
queue. That ensures thread-safety.<P>

<P>Likewise, when the queue is empty, <TT>get</TT> encounters a future for
<TT>xs</TT> and will block. This time, the future is eliminated by the next
<TT>put</TT> operation.</P>

<P>Let us create a channel and observe its content using the Inspector:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val ch : int Chan.chan = Chan.chan ()
<I>val ch : int Chan.chan = _val</I>
inspect ch
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P class=note><I>Note:</I> The interactive top-level prints the channel value

<P>Tuples are always evaluated from left to right, so we will deterministically
get the pair <TT>(17,6)</TT> in the last example. To witness non-determinism
due to concurrency, let us set up several clients. They perform an expensive
calculation before reading from the channel, in order to properly randomize
thread scheduling:</P>

<P>The order in which the threads will read from the channel is
non-deterministic, but no value will ever get lost or read twice.</P>

<?php section("packages", "packages") ?>

<P>Its powerful static type system is one of the major pros of ML. However,
there are programming tasks where it is not possible to perform all typing
statically. For example, consider exchange of data structures between separate
processes. To accompony such tasks of <EM>open programming</EM>, Alice
complements its static type system with a controlled form of dynamic
typing.</P>

<P>Alice provides the type <TT>package</TT> of dynamically typed values. A
<EM>package</EM> essentially is a pair of a (higher-order) module and its
signature. Packages are created using the <TT>pack</TT> expression:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val p = pack Word8 : WORD
<I>val p : package = package{|...|}</I></PRE>

<P>This example injects the module <TT>Word8</TT> into a package. The signature
constraint (the part following the colon) is part of the pack expression.
It specifies the package's signature. The packaged module must of course match
that signature statically.<P>

<!--
<P>Using the Inspector, we can look inside the package:</P>
-->

<P>The package <TT>p</TT> may be passed to some client, which may unpack it as
follows:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Word' = unpack p : WORD
<I>structure Word' : WORD</I></PRE>

<P>The <TT>unpack</TT> expression also requires a signature being specified.
Unpacking involves a dynamic type check: to evaluate the expression, the
package signature is matched against the specified target signature. If
matching succeeds, the packaged module is returned. Otherwise, an exception is
raised:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure List' = unpack p : LIST
<I>uncaught exception Mismatch</I></PRE>

<P>If unpacking succeeds, the client may use the <TT>Word'</TT> structure as
usual. The static signature of <TT>Word'</TT> is determined by the target
signature specified with <TT>unpack</TT>.</P>

<P>Since modules can contain arbitrary values, any value can be wrapped up as
packages. In particular, values can be given polymorphic type in packages:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val p = pack (val x = length) : (val x : 'a list -> int)
<I>val p : package = package{|...|}</I></PRE>

<P class=note>This example uses some <A href="modules.html#sugar">syntactic
sugar</A> of Alice ML, which allows replacing <TT>struct</TT>...<TT>end</TT>
and <TT>sig</TT>...<TT>end</TT> by <TT>(</TT>...<TT>)</TT>.</P>

<P>Unpacking may specify a more restrictive target signature:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure IntLength = unpack p : (val x : int list -> int)
<I>structure IntLength : sig val x : int list -> int end</I>
structure RealLength = unpack p : (val x : real list -> int)
<I>structure RealLength : sig val x : real list -> int end</I></PRE>

<P>The whole range of SML signature matching rules applies, so a package may
have more components than required by the target signature, may have more
general value types, or more specific type components, etc. Using packages
hence is quite robust with respect to extensions.</P>

<P>See the respective <A href="packages.html">manual page</A> for a more
detailed look at the semantics of packages. Packages are the basis of several
other features of Alice, in particular <A href="#pickling">pickling</A> and <A
href="#distribution">distribution</A>.</P>


<?php section("pickling", "pickling") ?>

<P>Applications rarely run in isolation. Many applications need to exchange
data with other applications, or make data persistent between runs.
Consequently, it should be possible to export and import data from processes.
Export of language data structures is often known as <EM>serialization</EM>, or
<EM>pickling</EM>.<P>

<P>Alice provides high-level support for pickling. Arbitrary data structures may
be pickled. Pickles are platform-independent and are hence suitable for exchange
across heterogenous networks, especially the Internet.</P>

<P>Since Alice ML is a functional language with first-class functions, pickling
is not restricted to conventional data but naturally includes the ability to
pickle functions. Like with other data, pickles containing functions are
platform-independent. This enables processes to exchange arbitrary procedures,
i.e. code.</P>

<P>The pickling library is based on <A href="#packages">packages</A>.
Consequently, the entities of import/export are modules. This implies that even
types and signatures can be exchanged between processes. Consider a very simple
abstract type as an example:</P>

<PRE class=code>
signature NUM =
sig
    type t
    fun fromInt : int -> t
    fun toInt   : t -> int
    fun add     : t * t -> t
end
<I>signature NUM =
   sig
      type t
      val fromInt : int -> t
      val toInt : t -> int
      val add : t * t -> t
   end</I>
structure Num :> NUM =
struct
    type t = int
    fun toInt n   = n
    fun fromInt n = n
    val add       = op+
end
<I>structure Num : NUM</I></PRE>

<DIV class=note>
<P><I>Note:</I> For values of abstract type the toplevel prints placeholders
only. However, the function <A href="library/print.html"><TT>Print.register</TT></A> can be used to install a user-defined printer for abstract types, e.g.
<PRE class=code>
Print.register (Int.toString o Num.toInt)</PRE>
enables the toplevel to print values of type <TT>Num.t</TT> in integer
representation.
</DIV>

<P>A package can be formed from this structure and be written to a file:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Pickle.save ("Num." ^ Pickle.extension, pack Num : NUM)
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P>To recover the structure in another (or the same) process, one simply
executes the inverse operation:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Num' = unpack Pickle.load ("Num." ^ Pickle.extension) : NUM
<I>structure Num' : NUM</I>
Num'.toInt (Num'.add (Num'.fromInt 4, Num'.fromInt 5))
<I>val it : int = 9</I></PRE>

<P>Note that the type <TT>Num'.t</TT> is incompatible with the original type
<TT>Num.t</TT>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Num'.add (Num.fromInt 4, Num.fromInt 5)
<I>0.0-0.39: argument type mismatch:
   Num.t * Num.t
does not match argument type
   Num'.t * Num'.t
because type
   Num.t
does not unify with
   Num'.t</I></PRE>

<P>The reason is that the signature at the <TT>unpack</TT> operation does not specify the necessary type equivalence - the types are statically incompatible, although they are known to be the same dynamically. The usual means of expressing type sharing can be used if that is not desired:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Num' = unpack Pickle.load ("Num." ^ Pickle.extension) : NUM where type t = Num.t
<I>structure Num' : 
   sig
      type t = Num.t
      val fromInt : int -> Num.t
      val toInt : Num.t -> int
      val add : Num.t * Num.t -> Num.t
   end</I></PRE>

<P>The result signature already indicates the type sharing, making legal</P>

<PRE class=code>
Num'.add (Num.fromInt 4, Num.fromInt 5)
<I>val it : Num'.t = _val</I></PRE>

<P>Note however, that the type <TT>Num'.t</TT> is still abstract and
incompatible to <TT>int</TT>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Num'.add (4, 5)
<I>v1.0-1.15: argument type mismatch:
   int * int
does not match argument type
   Num'.t * Num'.t
because type
   int
does not unify with
   Num'.t</I></PRE>

<!--

<?php section("components", "components") ?>

<P>Alice introduces the notion of <EM>component</EM> as the unit of
compilation, as well as deployment. Superficially, a component contains a
module that imports modules from other components to perform its job. An
application will consist of a set of components with one designated "main"
component.</P>

<P>Consider the following trivial component:</P>

<PRE class=code>
(* Fac.aml *)

structure Fac =
struct
    val _ = print "Evaluating component Fac...\n"

    fun fac 0 = 1
      | fac n = n * fac (n-1)
end</PRE>

<P>We can compile it invoking the Alice <A href="compiler.html">batch
compiler</A> from a shell:</P>

<PRE class=code>
alicec Fac.aml</PRE>

<P>If the interactive toplevel has been started in the same directory, the
compiled component can be imported interactively:</P>

<PRE class=code>
import "Fac"
<I>### loaded signature from file:/home/user/Fac
structure Fac : sig val fac : int -> int end = Fac</I></PRE>

<P>Loading is performed lazily: the interactive toplevel will load the
signature from the component file, but it will not yet evaluate (execute) the
component. This is appearent from the fact that the message contained in the
structure has not been printed in the above example. We can also see it when
accessing a structure field:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Fac.fac
<I>val it : int -> int = _lazy</I></PRE>

<P>The function is represented by a <A href="#laziness">lazy future</A>. The
component will be evaluated when its content is first requested:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Fac.fac 11
<I>Evaluating component Fac...
val it : int = 39916800</I>
Fac.fac 10
<I>val it : int = 3628800</I></PRE>

<P>Let us write a little application using the <TT>Fac</TT> component. We simply
implement an appropriate main component:</P>

<PRE class=code>
(* Main.aml *)

import structure Fac from "Fac"

structure Main =
struct
    fun main () =
	let
	    val _ = TextIO.print "Input number: "
	    val n = valOf (Int.fromString (valOf (TextIO.inputLine TextIO.stdIn)))
	in
	    TextIO.print (Int.toString (Fac.fac n) ^ "\n"); 
	    OS.Process.success
	end
	handle _ => (TextIO.print "error\n"; OS.Process.failure)

    val _ = OS.Process.exit (main ())
end</PRE>

<P>This component imports the structure from the previous component by using an
<EM>import announcement</EM>. Every component can be headed by an arbitrary
number of such import announcements. The <TT>Main</TT> component is compiled as
before:</P>

<PRE class=code>
alicec Main.aml</PRE>

<P>Note that the compiler needs to access all compiled components that are
imported, in order to perform its type checking (that also is the reason why the
interactive toplevel had to load the signature of component <TT>Fac</TT>). We
can run our little application using the Alice <A href="machine.html">virtual
machine</A>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
alicerun Main
<I>Input number: </I>8
<I>Evaluating component Fac...
40320</I></PRE>

<P>You can again observe that imports are performed lazily. If the <TT>Fac</TT>
component is never accessed, it will not be loaded at all:</P>

<PRE class=code>
alicerun Main
<I>Input number: </I>gnalp
<I>error</I></PRE>


<?php subsection("components-typechecking", "Link-time type checking") ?>

<P>A component carries its signature and the signatures of all its imports. You
can inspect them using the Alice <A href="linker.html">linker</A>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
alicelink -d Main
<I>import
   structure TextIO :
      sig
         type instream
         val inputLine : instream -> string option
         val stdIn : instream
         val print : string -> unit
      end
from "x-alice:/lib/system/TextIO"
import
   structure OS :
      sig
         structure Process :
            sig
               type status
               val success : status
               val failure : status
               val exit : status -> 'a
            end
      end
from "x-alice:/lib/system/OS"
import structure Fac : sig val fac : int -> int end from "Fac"
structure Main : sig val main : unit -> OS.Process.status end</I></PRE>

<P>The output first lists all imports required by the component (which includes
necessary parts of the <A href="library/index.html">library</A>) and then the
signature of its own export - in this case the last line. Note that import
locations are actually denoted by URLs. In this tutorial we will only make use
of file URLs, but components can actually be imported from arbitrary
locations via HTTP or FTP protocol.</P>

<P>Before a component is evaluated at runtime, its export signature is matched
against the import signature of the component that imports and requests it. If
that match fails, all references to items from the component are replaced by
failed futures. We can observe this if we modify and recompile our <TT>Fac</TT>
component in an incompatible way without adapting <TT>Main</TT>:

<PRE class=code>
(* Fac.aml modified *)

structure Fac =
struct
    val _ = print "Evaluating component Fac...\n"

    fun fac (0,n) = n
      | fac (i,n) = fac (i-1, i*n)   (* tail-recursive *)
end</PRE>

<P>An attempt to run the application without adapting <TT>Main</TT> properly
will cause a runtime failure:</P>

<PRE class=code>
alicec Fac.aml
alicerun Main
<I>Input number: </I>20
<I>Evaluating component Fac...</I>
<I>error</I></PRE>

<P>An application that strives to be robust against such failures should handle
the corresponding exceptions. See the <A href="components.html">manual
pages</A> on components for more details.</P>

<P>A way to avoid such errors is to statically <EM>link</EM> all components of
the application using the <A href="linker.html">static linker</A>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
alicelink --include ./ ./Main -o LinkedMain.acl
<I>alicelink: signature of component
./Fac
does not match import requirement of component
./Main
Try recompiling the latter.</I></PRE>

<P>Oops! The linker verifies that all import/export signatures are compatible. Of course, this is not the case since we intentionally made <TT>Fac</TT> incompatible. Recompiling <TT>Main</TT>, as the linker suggests, will not help either in this case.</P>

<P>But if we revert <TT>Fac</TT> to its original form and recompile it, the
linker will happily accept it:</P>

<PRE class=code>
alicec Fac.aml
alicelink --include ./ ./Main -o LinkedMain.acl</PRE>

<P>The linker builds a new component that bundles all components that are directly or
indirectly imported by the <EM>root component</EM> given on the command line
- in this case, <TT>Main</TT> - <EM>and</EM> that match the include pattern
specified. See the <A href="linker.html">manual page</A> for details.</P>


<?php subsection("components-pickles", "Relation to pickling") ?>

<P>There is a close connection between components and pickles. Actually, they
are interchangable: a pickle containing a structure can be imported as a
component; a component can be loaded as a pickle. The latter will automatically
evaluate the component.</P>

<P>That close connection allows us to construct precomputed components by
writing a component that computes it and writes it into an appropriate
pickle. For example:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Fac50 = struct val x = Fac.fac 50 end
<I>structure Fac50 : sig val x : int end</I>
Pickle.save ("Fac50." ^ Component.extension,
	     pack (structure Fac50 = Fac50)
	        : (structure Fac50 : sig val x : int end))
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P>Assume that calculating the factorial of 50 is an expensive computation. We
have now performed it statically and generated a component that exports the
result as a value. We may import it as usual:</P>

<PRE class=code>
import structure Fac50 from "Fac50"
<I>### loaded signature from file:/home/rossberg/Fac50
structure Fac50 : sig val x : int end = Fac50</I>
Fac50.x
<I>val it : int = _lazy</I>
Future.await Fac50.x
<I>val it : int =
   30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000</I></PRE>

<P>A pickle contains an <EM>evaluated component</EM>. Evaluated components are
closed, i.e. they never depend on any import:</P>

<PRE class=code>
alicelink -d Fac50
<I>structure Fac50 : sig val x : int end</I></PRE>

<P>The linker shows that there is only an export signature to this component.
See the <A href="components.html#evaluated">manual pages</A> on components for
more information on evaluated components.</P>

<?php subsection("components-manager", "Component managers") ?>

<P>Linking of components is handled by the system's <EM>component manager</EM>.
Applications may configure the component manager and the attached
<EM>resolver</EM> to adapt to their needs, or may even set up their own
component managers. Component managers essentially allow to achieve what is
often called <EM>sandbox security</EM> for untrusted components. See the <A
href="library/component-manager.html">library reference</A> for more
detail.</P>

<?php section("distribution", "distribution") ?>

<P><A href="#components">Components</A> and <A href="#pickling">pickles</A>
already provide a primitive form of distributed programming, since they may be
imported or loaded from arbitrary locations across a local network or even the
Internet. But Alice also provides high-level means for processes at different
sites to communicate directly.</P>

<?php subsection("distribution-tickets", "Tickets") ?>

<P>The first mechanism that allows sites to establish peer-to-peer connections
is <EM>offer and take</EM>. A process can create a package and make it available
to other processes, for example the <TT>Num</TT> structure from the previous
section:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val t = Remote.offer (pack Num : NUM)
<I>### loaded signature from x-alice:/lib/distribution/Remote
val t : ticket = "http://134.96.18\..."</I></PRE>

<P>Offering a package opens a communication port and returns an URI for that
port. The URI is called a <EM>ticket</EM>. A ticket can be transferred to other
sites, say by email or through some web document or root site. Other sites can
then obtain the available package using the ticket. Of course, the exporting
site may also obtain it itself (which we will do in this interactive example for
the sake of simplicity):</P>

<PRE class=code>
val p = Remote.take t
<I>val p : Package.package = package{|...|}</I>
structure Num' = unpack p : NUM
<I>structure Num' : NUM</I>
Num'.toInt (Num'.fromInt 444)
<I>val it : int = 444</I></PRE>

<P>In general, <TT>take</TT> establishes a connection to the communication port
denoted by the ticket, and retrieves the offered package. Transfer of the
package is defined by the pickling/unpickling semantics, i.e. the whole closure
of the package is transferred to the client, including any code representing
embedded functions.</P>

<?php subsection("distribution-proxies", "Proxies") ?>

<P>Tickets are intended merely as a means to establish an initial connection
between sites. All subsequent communication should be dealt with by the
functions in the offered package. Alice provides a very simple feature to
enable this idiom: <EM>proxies</EM>. A proxy is a mobile reference to a
stationary function, that can be used in place of the function it
references.</P>

<P>The library function <TT>proxy:</TT> <TT>('a->'b)</TT> <TT>-></TT>
<TT>('a->'b)</TT> creates a proxy for an arbitrary function:<P>

<PRE class=code>
fun fib (0 | 1) = 1
  | fib n       = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
<I>val fib : int -> int = _fn</I>
val fib' = Remote.proxy fib
<I>val fib' : int -> int = _fn</I></PRE>

<P>The resulting function has the same type as the function it references. When
it is applied, all arguments are forwarded to the original function, and the
result is transferred back:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fib' 20
<I>val it : int = 10946</I></PRE>

<P>However, pickling a proxy does only pickle the respective reference and not
the referenced function itself. When the proxy is transferred to a different
site - e.g. by offering it as part of a package - and then applied at that
site, all arguments will be automatically transferred to the site hosting the
referenced function, the result will be computed there, and finally transferred
back to the client site. That is, applying a proxy is practically a remote
procedure call (RPC). Transfer is again defined by pickling semantics.</P>

<?php subsection("distribution-example", "Example") ?>

<P>As a most general example consider a <EM>compute server</EM>, a server which
offers its computational resources to clients. Such a server can be described
by the following signature:</P>

<PRE class=code>
signature COMPUTE_SERVER =
sig
    val compute : ('a -> 'b) * 'a -> 'b
end</PRE>

<P>It can be given a function and an appropriate argument and it will compute
the result of applying the function to the argument.</P>

<P>Such a server is easily set up by packaging the straight-forward
implementation of this signature and offering it to other processes. Note the
use of a proxy:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure ComputeServer : COMPUTE_SERVER =
struct
    val compute = Remote.proxy (fn (f,x) => f x)
end
<I>structure ComputeServer : sig val compute : ('a -> 'b) * 'a -> 'b end</I>
val ticket = Remote.offer (pack ComputeServer : COMPUTE_SERVER)
<I>val ticket : ticket = "http://134.96.18\..."</I></PRE>

<P>Assume that the local HTTP server's domain is <TT>www.mydomain.net</TT> and
the root of its document tree is in directory <TT>/www</TT> of the local file
system. The server may store the ticket as a WWW document:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Pickle.save ("/www/computeserver.ticket", pack (val x = ticket) : (val x : string))
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P>A client can retrieve the (dynamically created) ticket from the (statically
known) ticket URL:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Ticket = unpack Pickle.load "http://www.mydomain.net/computeserver.ticket" : (val x : string)
<I>structure Ticket : sig val x : string end</I></PRE>

<P>It can then establish a connection by taking the offered package and
unpacking it under the agreed-upon signature:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Server = unpack (Remote.take Ticket.x) : COMPUTE_SERVER
<I>structure Server : COMPUTE_SERVER</I></PRE>

<P>Using the <TT>Server</TT> stub the client can shift its comutational load to
the compute server:<P>

<PRE class=code>
Server.compute (fib, 30)
<I>val it : int = 1346269</I></PRE>

<P>The application transfers the function <TT>fib</TT>, as well as the argument
<TT>30</TT>, to the server, which evaluates it. When it is done, it returns the
result.</P>

<P>It is important to note that only establishing the initial connection
requires a dynamic type check with this idiom! All subsequent uses of the
transferred structure in general, and the contained proxy in particular do
not require any check. Communication via proxies is always statically

<?php subsection("distribution-async", "Asynchronous communication") ?>

<P>You will have noticed that the remote call to the server is synchronous,
i.e. the client will not proceed before the server delivers the result.
However, a synchronous call can trivially be transformed into an asynchronous
one using <A href="#concurrency">functional threads</A>!</P>

<PRE class=code>
spawn Server.compute (fib, 30)
<I>val it : int = _future</I></PRE>

<P>Functional threads and futures hence are a high-level mechanism to improve
<EM>lag latency</EM> in distributed applications - a client can proceed
concurrently to the server and has to suspend only when it actually requires
the result of a remote operation that the server has not yet delivered.</P>

<?php subsection("distribution-remote", "Remote execution") ?>

<P>Sometimes applications themselves need to create new processes at remote
sites. This is known as <EM>remote execution</EM>. Remote execution can be
initiated using the <A href="library/remote.html#Execute">Execute</A> library
functor. See the respective <A href="distribution.html">manual page</A> for
more about distribution in general and remote exection in particular.</P>



<?php section("constraints", "constraints") ?>

<P>Alice ML provides full support for state-of-the-art constraint programming
technology. Constraint-based problem solving is a technique for solving hard
combinatorial problems that can be stated as variables ranging over a finite
domain of non-negative integers, or sets thereof. Problems in this class range
from puzzles to real world applications as diverse as scheduling, ware house
allocation, configuration and placement.</P>

<P>Let us take a first look at programming with <I>finite domain</I>
constraints. A finite domain (FD) is a set of natural (non-negative integer)
numbers. An FD <I>constraint</I> is a formula in predicate logic, containing
variables ranging over the natural numbers. In particular, a domain constraint
is a constraint that restricts the domain of a particular variable. A
<I>finite domain problem</I> is a finite set of quantifier-free constraints
that contains a domain constraint for every variable occurring in it. A
<I>solution</I> is a variable assignment that satisfies every constraint of the
problem.</P>

<P>Let us create some finite domain variables. We use the <A
href="library/linear.html"><TT>Linear</TT></A> library for linear
constraints:</P>

<PRE class=code>
open Linear
<I>### loaded signature from x-alice:/lib/constraints/Linear
...</I></PRE>

<P>To create a vector of constraint variables <I>x</I>,<I>y</I>,<I>z</I>, the
<TT>vec</TT> function can be used:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val #[x,y,z] = vec (3, [1`#10])
<I>val x : term = FD (_val)
val y : term = FD (_val)
val z : term = FD (_val)</I></PRE>

<P>The arguments to <TT>vec</TT> specify the number of constraint variables
(the size of the vector) and the initial domain {1,...,10} of each of these
variable. Every constraint variable must be created specifying such a domain
constraint. Constraint variables can be investigated using the Inspector:</P>

<PRE class=code>
inspect {x,y,z}
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-fd-1.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<P>For each variable, the Inspector shows the current set of values that still
might form a solution. The set of values still considered for a variable is
called its domain. Since we have not yet posted any constraints, the domains
are given by the initial domain constraints on the variables. The set of all
constraint variables and their domains is called the <I>constraint
store</I>.</P>

<P>The solution set can be restricted by posting constraints. For example, we
can require that 2<I>x</I> = <I>y</I>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
post (`2 `* x `= y)
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P class=note><EM>Note:</EM> Be aware of the backquotes prefixing numbers and
operators in the constraint formula - <TT>`*</TT> and <TT>`=</TT> are infix
functions, while the backquote preceeding the literal <TT>2</TT> is an ordinary
nonfix function.</P>

<P>The posted constraint will exclude certain values from the solution set.
This is reflected by shrinking the domains of the respective constraint
variables. After posting the above constraint, the Inspector recognizes that
the domains of the displayed constraint variables have changed and updates its
display accordingly:</P>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-fd-2.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<P>Adding a constraint can affect the domain of variables that do not even
occur in its formula, because information will be <I>propagated</I> in the
constraint store so that additional information can be inferred in combination
with other posted constraints:</P>

<PRE class=code>
post (z `< x)
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-fd-3.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<PRE class=code>
post (y `&lt; `7)
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-fd-4.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<P>The information encapsulated in the constraint store grows monotonically. A
variable is determined if its domain is reduced to a singleton set. A solution
is found when all variables are determined.</P>

<PRE class=code>
post (z `&lt;&gt; `1)
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-fd-5.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<P>Constraint propagation is not a complete solution method. It may happen that
a problem has a unique solution and that constraint propagation does not find
it. In those cases it is necessary to combine constraint propagation with
search. Alice hence also provides support for powerful, user-definable search
techniques. For a more thorough introduction to constraint programming, we
refer to the Oz <A href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/fdt/">Finite
Domain Constraint Programming Tutorial</A>. All constraint programming
functionality from Oz is available in Alice.</P>


<?php subsection("constraints-example", "Example") ?>

<P>As a simple example of a complete program solving a finite domain problem,
consider the <I>Send More Money</I> problem. It consists in finding distinct
digits for the letters <TT>S</TT>, <TT>E</TT>, <TT>N</TT>, <TT>D</TT>,
<TT>M</TT>, <TT>O</TT>, <TT>R</TT>, <TT>Y</TT> such that <TT>S</TT> and
<TT>M</TT> are different from zero (no leading zeros) and the equation

<PRE class=code>
SEND + MORE = MONEY</PRE>

<P>is satisfied. The unique solution of the problem is <TT>9567 + 1085 =
10652</TT>.</P>

<P>Using Alice, the problem can be solved as follows. First, we have to define
a so-called <I>script</I> that encodes the problem:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fun money () =
let
    val v as #[S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y] = vec (8, [0`#9])
in
    distinct v; 
    post (S `&lt;&gt; `0); 
    post (M `&lt;&gt; `0); 
    post (`1000`*S `+ `100`*E `+ `10`*N `+ D `+
	  `1000`*M `+ `100`*O `+ `10`*R `+ E `=
          `10000`*M `+ `1000`*O `+ `100`*N `+ `10`*E `+ Y ); 
    distribute (FD.FIRSTFAIL, v); 
    {S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y}
end
<I>val money :
   unit -> {D : term, E : term, M : term, N : term, O : term, R : term, S : term, Y : term} = _fn</I></PRE>

<P>The Send More Money problem cannot be solved using constraint propagation
alone. Search is required to reduce the problem space until constraint
propagation is able to determine the solution. The <TT>distribute</TT> function
in the script specifies the <I>distribution strategy</I> used when the problem
space has to be split for search. See the Mozart <A
href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/fdt/">Constraint Programming
Tutorial</A> for more detail.</P>

<P>To perform the actual search and obtain all solutions to the problem,
predefined search engines can be used:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Search.searchAll money
<I>val it :
   {D : term, E : term, M : term, N : term, O : term, R : term, S : term, Y : term} list =
   [{D = FD (_val), E = FD (_val), M = FD (_val), N = FD (_val), O = FD (_val),
     R = FD (_val), S = FD (_val), Y = FD (_val)}]</I></PRE>

<P>Using the inspector, we can easily look at the solution:</P>

<PRE class=code>
inspect it
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-fd-6.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<P>An alternative way to obtain the solutions is by interactively exploring the
search tree induced by the script using the <A
href="library/explorer.html"><EM>Explorer</EM></A>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Explorer.exploreAll money
<I>val it : unit = ()</I></PRE>

<P align=center><IMG src="explorer.jpg" border=0 alt="Alice Explorer"></P>

<P>Double-clicking on the only solution node in the search tree (the green
diamond) will open an Inspector window displaying the variable assignments of
the solution. Chosing an inner node will display the information available at
the respective point of the search tree.</P>


<?php section("interop", "interoperability") ?>

<P>The Alice compiler generates Oz pickled functors (<TT>.ozf</TT> files). The
Alice virtual machine is essentially a slightly beefed-up version of the Mozart
VM. As such, it can also run ordinary Oz applications.</P>

<P>More importantly, it is easily possible to create mixed Alice/Oz
applications. Oz code can import Alice functors as if they were Oz functors.
Alice can import Oz functors, if given an additional signature description file,
which specifies the types of the entities imported.</P>

<P>The possibility to mix Alice and Oz provides a smooth migration path for Oz
projects that want to use Alice. It also allows escaping the statically typed
world of ML for arbitrary subsystems, where that may be desirable. See the <A
href="interop.html">manual page</A> on interoperability for more detail.</P>
