<?php section("overview", "overview") ?>

<P>The interactive top-level provides an interpreter-style environment that
allows entering and evaluating programs from an interactive prompt. It can
be run either as a text-based shell application or with a graphical user interface. The text-based interactive top-level is designed to work with the standard <A
href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/contrib/emacs/">Emacs
mode</A> for SML. A patched version of that mode, modified to harmonize with
Alice ML syntax extensions, is also available from the Alice<A

page</A>.</P>

<?php section("description", "description") ?>

<P>The interactive top-level provides an interpreter-like read-eval-print loop.
In both, text mode and graphical mode, the system will - after preloading some components, show a prompt for its
interactive session. It allows entering arbitrary Alice components. Input
can stretch several lines, it is terminated by a line containing a semicolon as
its last character. The system will print the results and inferred types
for the given declarations, or an appropriate error message.</P>

<P>Nested and aggregated data structures are only printed up to certain depth and width limits. These can be controlled using the respective references from the <A href="library/print.html"><TT>Print</TT></A> module.</P>

<P>Values of abstract type are not printed. The <TT>register</TT> function from the <A href="library/print.html"><TT>Print</TT></A> module can be used to install simple user-defined printing functions for abstract types that the
top-level will use in its outputs.</P>

<P>Values of abstract type are not printed. The <TT>register</TT> function from the <A href="library/print.html"><TT>Print</TT></A> module can be used to install simple user-defined printing functions for abstract types that the
top-level will use in its outputs.</P>

<P>Note that the <TT>inspect</TT> function from the <A
href="library/inspector.html">Inspector</A> is available to browse complex
results conveniently.</P>

<?php subsection("description-use", "use") ?>

<P>Like in other SML systems, there also is the special purpose function</P>

<PRE class=code>
use : string -> unit</PRE>

<P>which, given the name of an Alice source file, will process this file as if
it had been fed as direct input.</P>

<?php subsection("description-import", "imports") ?>

<P>Each input in the interactive top-level actually is a <A
href="components.html">component</A>. This implies that import announcements
can be entered to link in separately compiled components from arbitrary
URIs:</P>

<PRE class=code>
- import structure Foo from "http://www.mydomain.net/Foo";
### loaded signature from http://www.mydomain.net/Foo
structure Foo : FOO = Foo
- </PRE>

<P>For convenience, it is possible to abbreviate import announcements as
follows in the interactive top-level:</P>

<PRE class=code>
- import "http://www.mydomain.net/Foo";
### loaded signature from http://www.mydomain.net/Foo
structure Foo : FOO = Foo
- </PRE>

<P>Such an announcement will import all items exported by the corresponding
component.</P>

<P>All <A href="library/index.html">library</A> components (except the <A
href="library/#gtk">GTK</A> library) are pre-imported in the interactive
top-level and will get loaded automatically on demand.</A>


<?php section("text", "text interface") ?>

<P>In text mode, a computation can be interrupted using Ctrl-C (the Posix signal SIGINT).<!-- Likewise, typed input can be discarded with Ctrl-C.--></P>

<P>A running computation can also be put into background using Ctrl-Z (the Posix signal SIGTSTP, Ctrl-Break on Windows), getting you back to the prompt. The computation will proceed concurrently. Intuitively, the effect is roughly as if the initial input had been prefixed with <A href="futures.html#spawn"><TT>spawn</TT></A>. However, it works for arbitrary inputs, particularly declarations.</P>

<P>An interactive session can be terminated by typing an end-of-file character
(Ctrl-D on Unix systems, Ctrl-Z on Windows systems). Alternatively, the global function <TT>exit</TT> may be called.</P>

<DIV class=note>
<P><I>Note:</I> Depending on the shell used, the Ctrl sequences described above may not work as expected under Windows. We recommend using either zsh under Cygwin, or the SML mode for Emacs. A plain Windows command shell will also work. Bash and particularly tcsh are known to be problematic with respect to signal handling. Alternatively, you might use the graphical mode.
</P>
</DIV>


<?php section("gui", "graphical interface") ?>

<P>When started with the command line option <TT>-g</TT> (or <TT>--gui</TT>),
the interactive top-level comes with a graphical user interface (this is the
default when Alice is started from the system's graphical interface - e.g. the Start menu - instead of a shell). The graphical interface not only incorporates the input-eval-print window, but also an Alice ML program editor. Most of the interface is standard editor functionality and should be self-explanatory. We only describe the Alice specific features here.</P>

<P>The window is split into three panes (two intially):</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The upper pane (initially closed) contains the editor and can open an arbitrary number of ML files in a tabbed text view.</LI>
  <LI>The middle pane is for interaction with the Alice top-level.</LI>
  <LI>The lower pane contains standard output and input streams of the Alice environment. Output on <TT>stdErr</TT> will be colored in red, while input by the user is shown in boldface.</LI>
</UL>
<P>With Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2, and Ctrl-3 the input focus can be moved quickly between the three panes. The panes can be resized by mouse.</P>


<?php subsection("gui-interaction", "Interaction") ?>

<P>The interaction pane operates much like the interactive top-level in text mode: ML snippets can be entered that can span several lines and must be terminated by semicolon. In addition, previous inputs can be retrieved via the history commands from the <I>Eval</I> menu (or the shortcuts Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down). History is saved when the top-level is quit.</P>

<P>The <I>Interrupt</I> and <I>Background</I> commands from the <I>Eval</I> menu allow aborting the current computation or putting it into background. The whole interpreter environment can be reset from the menu (note that this does not kill any running threads).</P>


<?php subsection("gui-feeding", "Feeding") ?>

<P>The <I>Eval</I> menu allows feeding portions of an editor window into the interactive session. This works in three ways:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>By selecting a region and invoking <I>Feed Region</I> (Ctrl-Return) the
  selected text will be fed into the interactive top-level as input.</LI>
  <LI>If nothing has been selected, invoking <I>Feed Region</I> will
  automatically select the <I>paragraph</I> surrounding the cursor, where
  a paragraph is a region of text delimited by emtpy lines.</LI>
  <LI>The whole file can be fed by invoking <I>Feed File</I> (Shift-Ctrl-Return).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Note that unlike direct input, fed input is not required to be terminated by a semicolon.</P>

<P>When input has been fed from a buffer, and an error occured, then selecting <I>Jump to Error</I> (Ctrl-E) from the <I>Edit</I> menu will immediately move the focus to the respective error location and select it.</P>


<?php subsection("gui-compilation", "Compilation") ?>

<P>By selecting <I>Compile</I> (Ctrl-K) from the <I>File</I> menu, the currently edited file can be compiled to a stand-alone component on disk. Eventual error messages will be printed on the interaction pane. Like with feeding, <I>Jump-to-Error</I> can be used to select the error region in case of an error.</P>
