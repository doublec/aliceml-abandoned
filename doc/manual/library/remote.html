  <P>
    This structure provides support for the implementation of distributed
    applications.  This includes exporting values from and importing values
    into sites, performing remote function application and starting a new
    site.  See the <A href="../distribution.html">distribution overview</A>
    for an introduction to the distribution facilities provided by Alice.
  </P>

  <P>
    Communication between sites is performed by <EM>cloning</EM> data
    structures.  Cloning is defined by <A href="pickle.html">pickling</A>.
  </P>
<!--
  <P>
    The current implementation uses HTTP as the transport protocol.
    Accordingly, tickets are URLs using the <TT>http</TT> scheme.

	<LI><P>The process in which the proxy was created has terminated.
	  In this case, <TT>Proxy(<A 
	  href="#Ticket-exn">Ticket</A>)</TT> will be raised.</P>
	<LI><P>A protocol failure occurs in the lower communication layers.
	  In this case, <TT>Proxy(<A 
	  href="#Protocol-exn">Protocol</A> <I>s</I>)</TT> will be raised,

	<LI><P>An I/O problem occurs in the lower communication layers.
	  In this case, <TT>Proxy(<A

	<P>Like proxy calls, remote execution may fail for a number of reasons:</P>
      <UL>
	<LI><P>The component contains a sited value. In that

	  <TT><A href="#Exit-exn">Exit</A></TT> is raised.</P>
	<LI><P>The export of the component contains a sited value after
	  evaluation on the remote site, or it contains a failed future that
	  carries an exception with a sited value or another failed
	  future. In all cases, <TT><A
	  href="#SitedResult-exn">SitedResult</A></TT> will be raised.
	  (Secondary failed futures are captured to prevent divergence in
	  the case of circular data structures.)</P>
	<LI><P>A protocol failure occurs in the lower communication layers.
	  In this case, <TT><A 
	  href="#Protocol-exn">Protocol</A> <I>s</I></TT> will be raised,
	  with <TT><I>s</I></TT> describing the error condition.</P>

	<P>With <TT>eval</TT>, the remote process will exit after
	evaluation of the component, regardless of any concurrent processes
	that may have been spawned by evaluation.
	With <TT>run</TT>, the remote process stays alive after the result is
	returned to the caller,
	i.e. the process is <I>not</I> terminated automatically. This
	allows concurrent threads to continue running; in particular, it enables
	the remote process to create proxies and return them to the caller who
	can therewith call into the remote process later.
	To terminate the process, an
	explicit call to <TT><A href="os-process.html">OS.Process.exit</A></TT>
	on the remote site is required. If evaluation of the component raises
	an exception, the process is terminated in both cases.</P>

	<P>Note that the <TT>ssh</TT> command must be available on the local
	site, you must be able to login on the remote site via SSH without
	entering a password (e.g. by using an SSH daemon),
	and the Alice System's <TT>bin</TT> directory must be in <TT>PATH</TT>
	on the remote site. On Linux, the latter can optionally be achieved by
	setting <TT>ALICE_REMOTE_PATH=<I>&lt;alice-bin-dir&gt;</I></TT> into
	your <TT>~/.ssh/environment</TT> file, if enabled. If that is not
	possible, you can fall back to having a script named
	<TT>aliceremote</TT> in your remote home directory, which
	sets paths appropriately and forwards its arguments to the
	<TT><A href="../machine.html">alicerun</A></TT> command of the Alice
	System.</P>

	<P>If the environment variable <TT>ALICE_REMOTE_LOG</TT> is set on the
	remote machine then its value will be interpreted as a file name and
	some logging information about the remote execution will be written to
	the file (without truncating it).</TT>
