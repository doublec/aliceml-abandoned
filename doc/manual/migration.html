  <P>Alice's component system has a lot in common with that of Oz.
    <?php if ($platform != "seam") { ?>
    As described in the <A href="interop.html">interoperability document</A>,
    Alice components are actually mapped to Oz functors.
    <?php } ?>
    However, we want to bring a number of differences to the attention
    of the prospective Alice user who knows Oz.</P>

<?php section("resolvers", "resolvers") ?>
  <P>Just like Oz, Alice uses <A href="library/resolver.html">resolvers</A>
    to locate resources.  In particular, localizing of components and pickles
    is performed under a resolver.  Where Oz initializes this resolver from
    the value of the <TT>OZ_LOAD</TT> environment variable, Alice uses the
    environment variables <TT>ALICE_LOAD_PREFIX</TT> and
    <TT>ALICE_LOAD_SUFFIX</TT> instead.</P>
  <P>
    <?php if ($platform != "seam") { ?>
    <TT>alicerun</TT> initializes <TT>OZ_LOAD</TT>, unless set, in the same
    way that <TT>ozengine</TT> does.
    <?php } ?>
    Alice's resolving methods are defined as follows:</P>
  <OL>
    <LI><P>If <TT>ALICE_LOAD_PREFIX</TT> is set, its methods are tried
      before any of the following.</P>
    <?php if ($platform == "seam") { ?>
    <LI><P>Otherwise, the URL is tried with the platform's default component
      extension appended, which is <TT>.alc</TT>.</P>
    <?php } else { ?>
    <LI><P>If the URL uses the <TT>x-oz</TT> scheme, it is tried as-is,
      for compatibility with Oz.</P>
    <LI><P>Otherwise, the URL is tried with the platform's default component
      extension appended, which is <TT>.ozf</TT>.</P>
    <LI><P>If that fails, the URL is tried as-is, for compatibility
      with Oz.</P>
    <?php } ?>
    <LI><P>If that fails, and <TT>ALICE_LOAD_SUFFIX</TT> is set, its methods
      are tried at this point.</P>
  </OL>

<?php section("componentmanagers", "component managers") ?>
  <P>Alice provides <A href="library/component-manager.html"
    >component managers</A>, which are similar to Oz
    <A href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/system/node7.html"
    >module managers</A>.
    <?php if ($platform != "seam") { ?>
    However, they have distinct implementations
    and may behave differently.
    <?php } ?>
    </P>
  <UL>
    <LI><P>Alice component managers do perform type-checking at link time,
      as opposed to Oz module managers.</P>
    <LI><P>The fact that a component is native is not indicated, as in Oz,
      by the <TT>{native}</TT> annotation of the component's URL.  Instead,
      the localized file is inspected to determine whether it is a pickled
      component or a native component and linked accordingly.</P>
    <LI><P>Exceptions raised during evaluation of components are
      wrapped inside a <TT><A href="library/component.html#Failure"
      >Component.Failure</A></TT> exception.  Oz module managers just
      propagate the exception as-is to all clients.</P>
  </UL>

<?php section("alicerun", "alicerun vs. ozengine") ?>
  <P>Alice provides its own command-line tool <A href="machine.html"
    ><TT>alicerun</TT></A> to run applications as a replacement to
    <A href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/tools/node1.html"
    ><TT>ozengine</TT></A> provided by Oz.  Both perform the same tasks
    of determining the installation directories, initializing environment
    variables, and launching the virtual machine to evaluate the component
    whose URL is given on the command line, along with further command line
    arguments.</P>
  <P>There are, of course, a number of differences.  <TT>ozengine</TT>
    uses an Oz module manager, using the <TT>OZ_LOAD</TT> resolver,
    while <TT>alicerun</TT> uses an Alice component manager, using the
    <TT>ALICE_LOAD</TT> resolver.
    <?php if ($platform != "seam") { ?>
    Because Alice component managers can link Oz functors, Oz applications
    can be started by <TT>alicerun</TT> without any change.  The converse,
    running Alice applications using <TT>ozengine</TT>, however requires the
    <TT>OZ_LOAD</TT> environment variable to be set to include all resolving
    methods enumerated <A href="#resolvers">above</A> for <TT>ALICE_LOAD</TT>.
    Note that this loses link-time type-checking however.
    <?php } ?>
  </P>

<?php section("alicelink", "alicelink vs. ozl") ?>
  <P>Alice uses its own <A href="linker.html"><TT
    >alicelink</TT ></A> tool as a replacement for
    <A href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/tools/node7.html"
    ><TT>ozl</TT></A>.  The tools differ in their behaviour as follows.</P>
  <UL>
    <LI><P><TT>alicelink</TT> uses the <TT>ALICE_LOAD</TT> resolver instead
      of the <TT>OZ_LOAD</TT> resolver, with all the implications detailed
      above.</P>
    <LI><P><TT>alicelink</TT> does not include any components by default.
      In particular, you need to explicitly specify an <TT>--include</TT>
      option for the root component.</P>
    <LI><P><TT>alicelink</TT> does not support anything similar to
      <TT>ozl</TT>'s <TT>--relative</TT> option (which is <TT>ozl</TT>'s
      default behaviour).  Resolved URLs may have to be made relative
      using explicit <TT>--rewrite</TT> options instead.</P>
    <LI><P>Rewriting in <TT>alicelink</TT> is more general.  It is based
      on <A href="library/resolver-handler.html#pattern">patterns</A> as
      defined by resolving instead of prefix replacement.  Accordingly,
      you need to use <TT>--rewrite from?{x}=to?{x}</TT> instead of
      <TT>--rewrite from=to</TT> to achieve the same effect as <TT>ozl</TT>.
      (Note that prefix matching as performed by <TT>--include</TT> and
      <TT>--exlude</TT> is not affected by this.)<P>
    <LI><P>Native components are not automatically excluded.  They need
      to be explicitly exluded using <TT>--exclude</TT> options.</P>
    <LI><P>Linked functors produced by <TT>ozl</TT> always evaluate all
      contained functors directly, either concurrently (one thread is started
      per functor) or sequentially (in case there are no cyclic dependencies,
      in an order consistent with topological dependencies).  In contrast,
      <TT>alicelink</TT> retains the same lazy evaluation order as the
      non-statically linked version.</P>
  </UL>
  <P>A close approximation for</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>ozl Foo.ozf -o LinkedFoo.ozf</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>would be</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>alicelink ./Foo --include ./ -o LinkedFoo.ozf</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<?php section("miscellaneous", "miscellaneous") ?>
  <P>As described above, the Alice resolver for components specified by
    <TT>ALICE_LOAD</TT> appends <B>file extensions</B>.  This is because in
    Alice, file extensions should always be omitted in component URLs such
    as in import announcements.  This is in contrast to Oz, which requires
    them.  Alice deviates from Oz for improved cross-platform compatibility.
    <?php if ($platform == "seam") { ?>
    Different virtual machines for Alice use different file extensions.
    For example, the SEAM-based Alice uses <TT>.alc</TT>, while the
    Mozart-based Alice uses <TT>.ozf</TT>.
    <?php } else { ?>
    The upcoming virtual machine for Alice uses a different file extension.
    <?php } ?>
  </P>
  <P>Abstract types in components carry strong identities.  Consequently,
    clients require <B>recompilation</B> when the definition of an abstract
    type they use is recompiled.  This is different from Oz, where a recompiled
    functor remains compatible to the previous compiled functor.</P>
  <P><TT>alicec</TT> does not support <B>cyclic imports</B>, as opposed to Oz.
    Alice component managers and the Alice static linker can handle cyclic
    imports, however.  You can implement cyclic Alice components using
    tricks.  This is not recommended, however.</P>
  <P><TT>alicec</TT> and <TT>alicelink</TT> do not yet implement an option
    to create <B>executable compiled components</B> as Oz does.  The same
    effect can be achieved however by manually prepending a shell script
    or executable, as Oz does.</P>
