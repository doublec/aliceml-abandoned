TODO list for the Alice IDE
===========================

Bugs:

* Text fields in search dialog should span full window
* Reconsider implicit imports
* Proper treatment of relative import/cwd
* Gtk.textIterFree produces segfaults, so at the moment it seems we can't properly free iterators :-(

Missing Features:

* completion
* bookmarks?
* configure autoindent, tab expansion?
* propagate output width on init and after resize (requires Pango binding)
* comment/uncomment region?
* cumulative undo?
* redo?
* incremental search?
