TODO list for the Alice IDE
===========================

Bugs:

* Not all dialogue buttons have icons
* Reconsider implicit imports
* Proper save changes treatment at quit?
* Cut&Paste with other apps doesn't work properly although it should :-(
* Gtk.textIterFree produces segfaults, so at the moment it seems we can't properly free iterators :-(

Missing Features:

* bookmarks
* propagate output width on init and after resize (requires Pango binding)
* comment/uncomment region?
* cumulative undo?
* redo?
* incremental search?
