  This chapter explains how to effectively use the services offered by SEAM
  by means of a real world language layer. The presentation is focused on the
  design aspects and does not include full code. The full source
  code can be downloaded as part of the Alice Source tree from

<?php pslab_header2("What is Alice?"); ?>
<P>
Alice is a functional programming language based on Standard ML,
extended with support for concurrent, distributed, and constraint programming.
Alice extends Standard ML with several new features: 
</P>

<UL>
<LI><EM>Laziness:</EM> combining strict and transparent
lazy functional programming 
<LI><EM>Futures:</EM> "logic variables" and concurrency 
<LI><EM>Higher-order modules:</EM> a more powerful module language 
<LI><EM>Components:</EM> platform-independence and type-safe dynamic
loading of modules 
<LI><EM>Packages:</EM> integrating static with dynamic
typing and first class modules 
<LI><EM>Pickling:</EM> higher-order and platform-independent,
type-safe persistence 
<LI><EM>Constraints:</EM>
solving combinatorical problems using constraints and programmable search 
</UL>

<?php pslab_header2("Overview"); ?>
<P>
  In order to build the Alice language layer, that is the <TT>alice.dll</TT>,
  on top of SEAM, several steps are required:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The Alice data model (including code!) is modelled on top of the store.
  <LI>Alice code execution is modelled on top of the generic execution model.
  <LI>Alice abstract platform services like builtins and the
      boot linker are modelled on top of SEAM generic services.
  <LI>Alice pickling is modelled on top of SEAM pickling by
      providing a set of Alice specific internalization handlers.
  <LI>The Alice FFI is modelled on top of SEAM's FFI. All we need to do
      is to define the marshalling of the newly defined alice types and the
      native compilation unit interface model (assumed by the boot linker).
  <LI>The Alice language layer main module needs to be defined.
</UL>
<P>Given this, the Alice VM becomes <TT>seam.exe alice.dll args</TT>,
   with <TT>args</TT> some alice component.
</P>
<?php pslab_header2("Alice Data Model"); ?>

<P>
  Standard ML runtimes usually are implemented using full type-erasure,
  that is, nothing of the ML static type information
  remains visible at runtime level.
  The same applies to the Alice language layer, conventiently
  obliviating the need to know about ML types on store data level.
</P>
<P>On runtime level, we have to model the following scalar types:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Alice characters: mapped to store integers
  <LI>Alice integers: mapped to store integers
  <LI>Alice reals: mapped to store doubles
  <LI>Alice strings: mapped to store string
</UL>
<P>On runtime level, we have to model the following composed types:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Alice cells: built <TT>Cell</TT> datatype on top of store.
  <LI>Alice arrays: built <TT>Array</TT> datatype on top of store.
  <LI>Alice Vector: built <TT>Vector</TT> datatype on top of store.
  <LI>Alice algebraic data types:
      built <TT>TagVal</TT> and <TT>BigTagVal</TT> datatypes on top of store.
  <LI>Alice constructed values:
      built <TT>Constructor</TT> and <TT>ConVal</TT> datatypes on top of store.
  <LI>Alice function closures: mapped to store closures.
  <LI>Alice unevaluated components: mapped to store closures.
  <LI>Alice evaluated components: built <TT>Record</TT> type on top of store.
</UL>
<PRE>
// Define labels of Alice data types
class Alice {
public:
  static const BlockLabel Array   = MIN_DATA_LABEL;
  static const BlockLabel Cell    = (BlockLabel) (MIN_DATA_LABEL + 1);
  static const BlockLabel ConVal  = (BlockLabel) (MIN_DATA_LABEL + 2);
  static const BlockLabel Record  = (BlockLabel) (MIN_DATA_LABEL + 3);
  static const BlockLabel Vector  = (BlockLabel) (MIN_DATA_LABEL + 4);

<HR>
<CENTER>Complete list of Alice datastructures (found in <TT>Data.hh</TT>)</CENTER>

<P>Alice algebraic datatypes are represented as store blocks that are given
an appropriate alternative number. By default, the tag field of the store
is used that severly limits the number of possible alternatives
(for example 128 on 32-bit implementations).
To circumvent this an additional implementation is provided that
uses an extra field to store the
alternative number.
Static type information allows for proper disambiguation
of the implementation used. The types are called <TT>TagTal</TT> and
<TT>BigTagVal</TT>, respectively.
</P>

<P>For documentary purposes, the full implementation of the array datatype
   is shown below:</P>
<PRE>
class AliceDll Array : private Block {
private:
  enum { LENGTH_POS, BASE_SIZE };
public:
  static const u_int maxLen = MAX_BIGBLOCKSIZE - BASE_SIZE;

  using Block::ToWord;

  static Array *New(u_int length) {
    Block *b = Store::AllocBlock(Alice::Array, BASE_SIZE + length);
    b->InitArg(LENGTH_POS, length);
    return STATIC_CAST(Array *, b);
  }
  static Array *FromWord(word x) {
    Block *b = Store::WordToBlock(x);
    Assert(b == INVALID_POINTER || b->GetLabel() == Alice::Array);
    return STATIC_CAST(Array *, b);
  }
  static Array *FromWordDirect(word x) {
    Block *b = Store::DirectWordToBlock(x);
    Assert(b->GetLabel() == Alice::Array);
    return STATIC_CAST(Array *, b);
  }

  u_int GetLength() {
    return Store::DirectWordToInt(GetArg(LENGTH_POS));
  }
  void Init(u_int index, word value) {
    InitArg(BASE_SIZE + index, value);
  }
  void Update(u_int index, word value) {
    ReplaceArg(BASE_SIZE + index, value);
  }
  word Sub(u_int index) {
    return GetArg(BASE_SIZE + index);
  }
};
</PRE>
<P>The basic procedure is simple: select a unique label for the data type,
   derive from the appropriate base class, provide your own constructor and
   tag conversion and finally provide the requires accessors.
   In case you need to provide internal and external representation, it
   is required to derive from the <TT>ConcreteRepresentation</TT> base class.
   More details will be explained later.
<P>Remember that each store block is guaranteed only to be at least
   of the size requested. It might be larger as well. Therefore, it is required
   (as for example for arrays and vectors) to additionally store
   the requested size in case this is needed because the
   default <TT>GetSize()</TT> will return the effective block size.
   However, for a statically typed language like Alice most datatypes do not
   need to store their exact size as their size is statically known.
</P>
<P>You might have noted the <TT>AliceDll</TT> flag. This is to provide the
   appropriate DLL import/exports declarations on Windows and defaults to
   the empty string on Unix-like operating systems.</P>

<?php pslab_header2("Alice Code Execution"); ?>

<P>This section highlights the design ideas of alice code
and how its execution is implemented on top of SEAM.
</P>

<?php pslab_header3("Code Design Ideas"); ?>

<P>Alice is a functional language.
Apart from the goals of genericity and simplicity,
six central design decisions were made for its code representation:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Code is data, that is, modelled on top of the SEAM store
<LI>Recursive function calls are expressed through identifiers
<LI>Loops are translated into recursive function calls
<LI>Control-flow is represented explicitly (in particular, control flow joins)
<LI>Identifier liveness information is exact
(by means of explicit kill instructions)
<LI>Minimize the number of different instructions by using primitives instead.
This decision relies on the fact that static type information
often allows for easy runtime optimization of these constructs
as part of the transformation process.
</UL>
<P>
Alice code is represented as a directed acyclic graph that is
well suited for the needs of runtime transformation, in particular runtime
compilation to native code.
The DAG representation is defined to be the external representation of the code.
The current implementation supports two internal representations of Alice code:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The abstract code itself which is then interpreted
(optionally with debug annotations)
<LI>Runtime-compiled native code.
</UL>
<P>In support for efficient runtime compilation, the code representation is
extended with an annotations field that carries
statically pre-computed information to speed up runtime processing.
In particar, this includes approximated identifier liveness information suitable
as input to linear-scan register allocation.
</P>
<P>
Note that storing code as a DAG in the first place together with
explicit control flow information removes the need for clumsily
reconstructing this information from plain byte code at runtime.
</P>
<?php pslab_header3("Implementation"); ?>
<P>Implementing (Alice) code and its execution requires several steps to be done:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Define the code itself:
Alice code is defined as a regular algebraic datatype in Alice,
therefore code is of type <TT>TagVal</TT> on runtime level.
<LI>We need to provide our own <TT>ConcreteCode</TT>
to use the runtime transformation offered by SEAM pickling.
<LI>We need to provide our own interpreter together with its own stack frame
</UL>
<P>
Below the code interfaces for the interpreted concrete representation are shown:
</P>
<PRE>
class AliceDll AliceConcreteCode : private ConcreteCode {
private:
  enum { ABSTRACT_CODE_POS, TRANSFORM_POS, SIZE };
public:
  static word New(TagVal *abstractCode);

  TagVal *GetAbstractCode();

</PRE>
<P>So far, only interfaces have been shown. Now we will show some of the
method bodies:
</P>
<PRE>
word AliceConcreteCode::New(TagVal *abstractCode) {
  abstractCode->AssertWidth(AbstractCode::functionWidth);
  ConcreteCode *concreteCode =
    ConcreteCode::New(AbstractCodeInterpreter::self, SIZE);
  Chunk *name =
    Store::DirectWordToChunk(AliceLanguageLayer::TransformNames::function);

  frame->InitArg(FORMAL_ARGS_POS, formalArgs);
  return STATIC_CAST(AbstractCodeFrame *, frame);
}

// This is shown to give the reader an impression on how computation on SEAM
// works. It will not be explained in detail.
Worker::Result AbstractCodeInterpreter::Run(StackFrame *sFrame) {
  AbstractCodeFrame *frame = STATIC_CAST(AbstractCodeFrame *, sFrame);
  Assert(sFrame->GetWorker() == this);
  TagVal *pc = frame->GetPC();

  Vector *formalArgs = frame->GetFormalArgs();
  ...
  while (true) {
  loop:
    switch (AbstractCode::GetInstr(pc)) {
    ...
    case AbstractCode::PutVar: // of id * idRef  * instr
      {
	localEnv->Add(pc->Sel(0), GetIdRefKill(pc->Sel(1), pc,
					       globalEnv, localEnv));
	pc = TagVal::FromWordDirect(pc->Sel(2));
      }
      break;
    ...
    case AbstractCode::Raise: // of idRef
      {
	word requestWord = GetIdRef(pc->Sel(0), globalEnv, localEnv);
	Transient *transient = Store::WordToTransient(requestWord);
	if (transient != INVALID_POINTER) REQUEST(transient->ToWord());
	KillIdRef(pc->Sel(0), pc, globalEnv, localEnv);
	Scheduler::currentData = requestWord;
	Scheduler::currentBacktrace = Backtrace::New(frame->Clone());
	return Worker::RAISE;
      }
      break;
    ...
    default:
      Error("AbstractCodeInterpreter::Run: unknown instr tag");
    }
  }
}
</PRE>
<P> In case of the native code, things are analog except for one complication.
The native concrete code at first consists of a so-called byneed value that
encapulates the actual runtime compilation. Once the byneed is requested,
the runtime compilation takes place and finally the byneed is
bound to the resulting real native concrete code. Remember that reference
chains of bound transients are eventually cut by SEAM's garbage collector.
</P>
<P>The main task of the runtime compiler consists of detecting special
cases related to function application, in particular the elimination of
unnecessary invokations of <TT>Scheduler::PushCall</TT>.
Native functions are invoked directly and important
primitives are inlined once enough context information is available to the
runtime compiler.
</P>

<?php pslab_header2("Alice Pickling"); ?>

<P>Alice pickling is built on top of SEAM pickling by defining the following
   transforms:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><TT>"Alice.function"</TT>: Defines how Alice functions are represented,
in particular their code body.
<LI><TT>"Alice.primitive.function"</TT>: Defines how Alice primitives are
represented. Primitives are functions implementing native functionality that is
part of the abstract platform.
<LI><TT>"Alice.primitive.value"</TT>: Similar to primitive functions, but for
certain values.
<LI><TT>"Alice.constructor"</TT>: Used for representing unique constructors.
</UL>
<P>Setting up a transform is easy, for example <TT>Alice.function</TT>:
</P>
<PRE>
  ...
  static word AliceFunctionHandler(word x) {
    TagVal *abstractCode = TagVal::FromWordDirect(x);
    return AliceLanguageLayer::concreteCodeConstructor(abstractCode);
  }
  ...
  String *aliceFunction = String::New("Alice.function");
  TransformNames::function = aliceFunction->ToWord();
  RootSet::Add(TransformNames::function);
  Unpickler::RegisterHandler(aliceFunction, AliceFunctionHandler);
  ...
</PRE>
<P>In the example above, the <TT>AliceLanguageLayer::concreteCodeConstructor</TT>
of course has to do the main work of creating the internal representation.
The point here is that registering your own handlers is all you need to do
to "teach" SEAM pickling your language specific representation transformations.
In the current implementation, the concrete code constructor either points
to <TT>AliceConcreteCode::New</TT> or <TT>NativeConcreteCode::New</TT>,
depending on the users selection.
</P>

<?php pslab_header2("Alice BootLinker"); ?>

<P>
Alice language components are implemented as a pair consisting of an interface
(called signature) and a structure implementing this interface.
The Alice VM now needs a initial way of obtaining Alice components at runtime,
which is performed by the Alice BootLinker. Its interface is shown below.
</P>
<PRE>
struct AliceDll NativeComponent {
  const char *name;
  word (*init)();
};

class AliceDll Component: private Block {
private:
  static const u_int ENTRY_LABEL = MIN_DATA_LABEL;
  enum { SIGN_POS, STR_POS, SIZE };
public:
  word GetSign();
  word GetStr();

  static Component *New(word sign, word str);
  static Component *FromWordDirect(word entry);
  using Block::ToWord;
};

class AliceDll BootLinker {
private:
  static word componentTable;
  static word keyQueue;
  static u_int numberOfEntries;
  static ChunkMap *GetComponentTable();
public:
  static void Init(NativeComponent *nativeComponents);
  static Queue *GetKeyQueue();
  static u_int GetNumberOfEntries();
  static void EnterComponent(String *key, word sign, word str);
  static Component *LookupComponent(String *key);
  static void Link(String *url);
  static void Link(Thread *thread, String *url);
};
</PRE>
<DL>
  <DT><TT>Init(nativeComponents)</TT></DT>
  <DD>
    <P>The boot linker is initialized with a set of native components
       that will be evaluated and entered in the global component table.
    </P>
  </DD>
  <DT><TT>EnterComponent(key, sign, str)</TT>
  <DD>
    <P>Enters an evaluated component into the global components table.
       It will be accessible under key <TT>key</TT> and the components
       signature and structure are denoted by <TT>sign</TT>
       and <TT>str</TT>, respectively.
    </P>
  </DD>
  <DT><TT>LookupComponent(key)</TT></DT>
  <DD>
    <P>Performs a component lookup using key <TT>key</TT>.
       Indicates failure by returning <TT>INVALID_POINTER</TT>.
    </P>
  </DD>
  <DT><TT>LinkComponent(url)<BR>
          LinkComponent(thread, url)</TT></DT>
  <DD>
    <P>Tries to link the component denoted by url <TT>url</TT>.
       In case linking succeeds, the resulting component will be entered
       into the component table.
       The latter alternative tries to link currently within the thread denoted
       by <TT>thread</TT>.
    </P>
  </DD>
</DL>

<P>The Alice boot linker is fully implemented on top of SEAM, however,
a bit lengthy because of a bunch of side conditions to be tested for.
Since it requires a lot of understanding of the Alice component model, only the
boot linker interface is shown for explanatory purposes.
</P>

<?php pslab_header2("Alice FFI"); ?>

<?php pslab_header3("Example"); ?>

<P>The Alice FFI corresponds to the
<A href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/seam/manual/ffi.html">SEAM FFI</A>
except that Alice defines its own component interface.
It is best understood by looking first at an
example, the <TT>AliceTimer</TT> component:
<PRE>
#include "Alice.hh"

static double startTime;

DEFINE0(Timer_start) {
  // Time::GetElapsedMicroseconds is part of the public SEAM interface
  startTime = Time::GetElapsedMicroseconds();
  RETURN_UNIT;
} END

DEFINE0(Timer_check) {
  double curTime = Time::GetElapsedMicroseconds();
  double result = (curTime - startTime) / 1000.0;
  RETURN(Store::IntToWord(static_cast<int>(result)));
} END

word InitComponent() {
  Record *record = Record::New(2);
  INIT_STRUCTURE_N(record, "AliceTimer", "start",
		   Timer_start, 0, 1);
  INIT_STRUCTURE_N(record, "AliceTimer", "check",
		   Timer_check, 0, 1);
  RETURN_STRUCTURE("AliceTimer$", record);
}
</PRE>
<P>Similar to the SEAM FFI, components need to include <TT>Alice.hh</TT> to
get started. Defining functions is unchanged except for some more pre-defined
data types.
</P>
</P>Alice component interfaces are records to allow for runtime
pruning and merging of fields which takes place as part of type coercions.
You need to allocate a record whith a sufficient number of slots,
equaling the number of entities you wish to export. No ordering applies
to the entries since access is performed by name via hashing.
</P>
<P>
Alice native components are compiled using <TT>alicetool</TT> which
is a wrapper for <TT>seamtool</TT> that takes care of adding the
appropriate include pathes.
</P>

PrimitiveTable. This table is used by the corresponding
<TT>Alice.primitive.function</TT>
and <TT>Alice.primitive.value</TT> transform to obtain
the internal representation.
The code snipped shown below shows how these primitives
are registered.
