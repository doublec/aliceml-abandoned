2000-05-20  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

        * misc.c (gdk_imlib_init): uses GdkRGB visual instead of X's
        default visual.  Behaves better on Solaris.
        (gdk_imlib_init_params): ditto

2000-04-14  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* misc.c (gdk_imlib_init_params): Use the correct parsing method
	to get the visual number from the specified file.
	(gdk_imlib_init): ditto.  

2000-02-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* colors.c (alloc_colors): New function to allocate a color array.
	This is the meaty part from gdk_imlib_load_colors() moved over to
	its own function.
	(gdk_imlib_load_colors): Use alloc_colors().  Do not print a
	message if we cannot open the file, since we are already returning
	an error code.
	(gdk_imlib_load_default_colors__private): New function to allocate
	a hardcoded default palette.
	(PaletteAlloc): Made static, renamed from _gdk_imlib_PaletteAlloc.

	* gdk_imlib_private.h: Added prototype for
	gdk_imlib_load_default_colors__private().

	* misc.c (gdk_imlib_init): Load a default palette if the palette
	file could not be loaded.  Bail out if no colors could be
	allocated.  Maybe we could just use BlackPixel and WhitePixel.

2000-02-22  Morten Welinder  <terra@diku.dk>

	* utils.c (gdk_imlib_create_image_from_xpm_data): Leak fix.

1999-10-16  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@online.no>

	* colors.c (PaletteLUTSet): Removed unused variables.

1999-09-02  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* rend.c (gdk_imlib_best_color_match): 
	Fix typo - `g_return_val_if_fail', not `g_return_val_fail'.
	(_gdk_imlib_index_best_color_match): Likewise.

1999-09-02  Pavel Machek  <pavel@artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* rend.c, globals.c, misc.c: No need to allocate structure
	dynamically - it is needed, always. 
	Turned some fprintf(stderr) into g_return_val_if_fail as they 
	seem much cleaner to me. 
	
Fri Apr 2 15:28:28 1999  Asbjorn Pettersen  <ape@spacetec.no>

	* gdk_imlib_private.h: replace <sys/types.h>.
 	Needed for OS/2 version.

1999-03-22  Pavel Machek  <pavel@artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* globals.c: robustness: you better keep gdk_imlib_data
 	initialized to NULL

1999-02-11  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* misc.c: Don't overwrite existing locale settings, just 
	 temporarily set LC_NUMERIC to "C", then restore it.

1999-02-11  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* utils.c: Since when did sizeof() be the same as strlen() on char*'s?
	Also changed some malloc() + strcpy() -> strdup().

1999-02-11  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* Recommend 1.0.3 instead of 1.0.1 (if broken 1.0.2)

1999-01-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* modules.c: Make the gdk_imlib_load_alpha and
	gdk_imlib_inlined_png_to_image routines be exported.

1999-01-16  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* gdk_imlib_private.h:
	Include gdkx.h for definition of gdk_window_foreign_new in misc.c.

	* io-png.c (_loader_alpha_png):
	Correct variable declarations to get rid of unused vars;

	* modules.c (get_module_loader_saver):
	Function now returns value.  FIXME: The value is never used,
	should probably be converted to a void function.

1998-12-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* cache.c (gdk_imlib_set_cache_info, gdk_imlib_get_cache_info):
	To control the cache externally.

	* cache.c (gdk_imlib_flush_old_entries, gdk_imlib_flush_cache):
	New empty routines.  An API we might use in the future.  Better
	have it here before :-)

1998-12-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gdk_imlib_private.h: Moved structure members that depended on
	HAVE_SHM to the end of the strucutre, where they do not hurt us.

	The problem is as follows: If HAVE_SHM is defined at Imlib compile
	time, then the Xdata structure is expanded to have these two
	fields.  Since we do not test for SHM in other places where we
	access _gdk_imlib_data (which caused the Alpha crashes and the
	duplicated icons due to the cache changes).

1998-12-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* load.c (_gdk_imlib_LoadBMP): This code got lost by accident.

1998-12-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* rend.c (gdk_imlib_render): Small typo correction.

1998-12-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* misc.c (gdk_imlib_init): Use sizeof (s) instead of 4096 while
	reading from the files.  If someone ever changed these, we would
	be in trouble.

	* load.c (gdk_imlib_load_image): Use "file" instead of "fil" in
	the call to _gdk_imlib_LoadTIFF (to make it work with wierd filenames).

	* gdk_imlib_private.h: Clean up the name space.  All of the
	internal routines that were previously exposed are now prefixed
	with _gdk_imlib_ instead of a mix of g_ and g.

	GdkImlibData data variable "id" is now called _gdk_imlib_data. 

	* misc.c (HandleXError): This one is static.

	* load.c (gdk_imlib_load_image): On GNOME we do not enable
	spawning any external processes.  Specially with the setup
	currently implemented.  Play it safe, we do not want to appear on
	BUGTRAQ because of this feature. 

	* utils.c (gdk_imlib_set_image_red_curve,
	gdk_imlib_set_image_green_curve): Code changes to make it work
	with the new im->map setup. Make it check its input arguments,
	according to GTK+/GDK conventions.
	(
	(gdk_imlib_apply_modifiers_to_rgb): Adapt as well.

	* cache.c (gnullify_image): Release im->map if it exists.

	* rend.c (gdk_imlib_render): Instead of testing for the defaults
	here, we need only to test againt im->map now (as the im->map will
	have a non-NULL value if a map even exists).

	* utils.c (gcalc_map_tables): Test here if the color modifiers are
	the defaults, and if so mark do not compute the modifier table,
	and free any existing modifier table if it exists.

Wed Sep 23 11:21:49 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* rend.c (gdk_imlib_pixmap_foreign_new): Create pixmap
	with g_new0, instead of g_new, to increase the chances
	that all fields are initialized properly.

1998-06-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* misc.c (gdk_imlib_init): Let the user use --no-xshm by checking
	the setting on Gdk.

1998-05-18  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* misc.c (gdk_imlib_init): Initialize uninitialized variables.

	* rend.c: Remove unused variables.
	
1998-05-07  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* save.c (gdk_imlib_save_image): Replaces `snprintf' with
	`g_snprintf' calls. 
	* utils.c (gdk_imlib_create_image_from_data): Likewise.

Tue May  5 15:11:59 1998  Radek Doulik  <gis@academy.cas.cz>

	* replaced snprintf calls with g_snprintf ones, so it
	compiles now on SunOS 

Sat Apr 11 12:30:13 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* utils.c: fixed yet one more SIGFPE on alpha

Fri Mar 20 00:02:43 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* gdk_imlib.h: Replaced `()' with `(void)'.

Sun Mar 15 12:34:45 1998  Owen Taylor <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added GTK_CFLAGS

1998-02-25  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (DEFS): Define `SYSTEM_IMRC' too.

1998-02-25  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* misc.c (gdk_imlib_copy_image): The drawable passed to gdk_gc_new
	should be the dest drawable, not the base imlib window.  This
	caused BadMatches all over the place (especially in copy_mask).
	(gdk_imlib_copy_mask): Likewise.

1998-02-24  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (DEFS): New var.  Moved stuff from CFLAGS.
	(INCLUDES): New var.

1998-02-24  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (libgdk_imlib_la_SOURCES):
	(lib_LTLIBRARIES): changed gdk_imlib to use the libtool+automake
	formalisms.

	* load.c (gdk_imlib_load_image): changed JPEG_PATH to DJPEG_PROG
	and removed %s/djpeg, sine DJPEG_PROG is the full program path.

1998-02-17  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.in (install): Make directory for config files.

	* configure.in: Fixed ENL_LIB_SUPPORT function for non-existing libraries.

1998-02-16  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* misc.c (gdk_imlib_init): I create a colormap specific to the
	visual the base_window will be using.  This fixes BadMatch errors
	on machines with multiple visual/depth combinations.

1998-02-17 The Rasterman <raster@redhat.com>

        * misc.c (gdk_imlib_init) Fixed visual stuff slightly, and Colormap 
	creation (so it only does so if the visual for the default and the 
	chosen visual mismatch), added function calls to retrieve Imlib's 
	visual and Colormap, plus endianess fixes for network displaying.

1998-02-17 The Rasterman <raster@redhat.com>

	added system imrc config return function

1998-02-18 The Rasterman <raster@redhat.com>

	Fixed load.c - missed a not (!) in an if clause
