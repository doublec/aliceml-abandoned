	  patch them in again CAREFULLY. This rveert may revert your patch.

Tue Oct 20 03:10:28 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Imlib/snprintf.c: snprintf implementation for systems without it

	* Imlib/Makefile.am, configure.in: support for snprintf.c

	* Imlib/cache.c, Imlib/colors.c, Imlib/load.c, Imlib/misc.c,
	Imlib/rend.c, Imlib/save.c, Imlib/utils.c: removed the #warning
	crap (not portable) and #define snprintf my_snprintf for the no

Tue Sep 15 14:35:40 CDT 1998 mej <mej@mw.3com.com>

Sun Sep 13 18:53:32 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

Fri Sep  4 11:54:05 EDT 1998 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	png "too old" test to make it correctly reject more versions.

1998-07-13  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* imlib-config.in (--libs): Reorder libraries.
	(--libs-gdk): Likewise.

1998-06-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* utils/imlib_config.c (read_imrc): Correctly handle the output of
	sscanf.  This was broken, broken, broken.  The code is still
	Raster-style though.

	* configure.in (AC_SUBST): Remove `config/imrc'.

Tue Jun  9 01:13:26 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: Redid graphics lib checks, they are far
	more robust now.

1998-05-15  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	configure.in.

Sun Mar 15 12:33:01 1998  Owen Taylor <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* utils/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Include GTK_CFLAGS, not X_CFLAGS.
	(LDADD): Include GTK_LIBS, not explicit gtk/X libraries.

	* configure.in: Use AM_PATH_GTK to find gtk.  Don't use
	AC_CHECK_LIB.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Conditionally build in gdk_imlib.

1998-02-26  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* general: removed all the old Makefile.in files, since raster has
	now endorsed the automakification.

1998-02-24  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* utils/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Also include $(X_CFLAGS).
	(LDADD): Use `libtool', and also link in all those `gtk+' stuff.
	Should probably autoconf this stuff a bit more.

1998-02-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* utils/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added INCLUDES so that it can find
	the gdk_imlib headers.  I hope this is the right way to do it.

1998-02-24  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: added AM_PROG_LIBTOOL so we can generate shared
	libraries.
