Description:

* We implemented all tiers (tier 2 is not bug-free however...). 
* We tried to do a clean (modular & strongly typed) design,
  efficiency was only of secondary concern.
  - The renderer kernel is completely independent of the abstract machine.
  - Likewise, the Machine completely encapsulates the renderer.


Examples:

In examples/helikopter.gml you'll find a neat example. ;-)
